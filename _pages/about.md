Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where
I'm advised by [Nigel Bosch](https://pnigel.com/) and [Jana Diesner](https://www.gov.sot.tum.de/hcc/home/). 
Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at UIUC.
