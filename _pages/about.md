Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I'm advised by 
[Nigel Bosch](https://pnigel.com/) and [Jana Diesner](https://www.gov.sot.tum.de/hcc/home/). 

I study how AI can be leveraged to help people become better self-regulated learners, such as by developing the ability to think critically about their own learning process and applying metacognitive strategies. 


I approach this work through three complementary research goals: 
           
1. Modeling self-regulated learning in computer-based learning environments using learning analytics
              
2. Designing and developing explainable AI systems to support self-regulated learning

3. Assessing the fairness of these AI systems, particularly for underserved learners (e.g., individuals diagnosed with ADHD). 

Before beginning my PhD, I earned my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at UIUC. Outside of research, I love walking my dog and exploring new places when I travel.
