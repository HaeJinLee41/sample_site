## Modeling Self-regulated Learning using Learning Analytics

To design and develop XAI-driven interventions that help individuals learn, practice, and develop self-regulated learning skills, it is crucial to understand how these skills manifest in computer-based learning environments. To achieve this, I leverage machine learning, data mining (e.g, sequential pattern mining), and statistical methods (e.g., hierarchical linear modeling), grounded in learning theories, to measure the application of these skills.
